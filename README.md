# METEOBOX01
Meteobox is a universal platform for logging data from various sensors, aiming primarily on sensors of meteorological variables. This platform was designed for purpose of comparing multiple sensors to each other or with other measuring systems. The device is not traying to be another meteorological station. 
This is primarily due to the features where multiple identical sensors can be connected to the device or  easy implementation of new sensors. 

The platform primarily requires a power source for working. Data transmission can be secured by internal LTE modem, ethernet connection or by wifi connection. Device supports remote monitoring. 

## Abilities
The system records data from sensors connected via various interfaces. The data is immediately logged into the internal time-siries database. A CSV file is exported every hour, which serves as a backup and is automatically uploaded to a remote server. The system is equipped with a grafana dashboard for visualization of live data.
